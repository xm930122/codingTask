# Tritium Web interview demo project

This is a coding test for Web candidates for Tritium Research Frontend Team. This Demo project is a tiny taste of what you'll be working on if you join us.

Before proceeding to the section of your choice, please consider the following tips.

## General Advice and Tips

- Error scenarios，e.g. edge case/conner case, should be taken into consideration, even if you don't explicitly handle them.
- We are concerned in this demo with your thought process and with how you architect your application as well as UI and UX implementation. Your demo should take into consideration features that might be added in the future.
- Consider the security, maintainability and testability of the code.
- Clean the file project structure and remove any unused methods and code. This shows attention to detail.
- Be opinionated regarding any architecture you use and take your time to make it a reflection of your thought process.

## The project

-You will implement a trending token list.
-You will use a WebSocket subscription as data source, which pushes updates at intervals of approximately 1–3 seconds after the initial push.
-You may need VPN to get access to the websocket.
-When you are unsure about the user interaction in design, you can refer to GMGN (https://gmgn.ai/) and Binance Web3 (https://web3.binance.com/).

### Requirements

The following requirements should be met:

- Use TypeScript + React.
- Use Next.js.
- It should compile and run.
- You must create a repo in Github for this project，and commit your code to the repo continuously in git commits. Send us the link to the repo when you are done, and do not forget to make it public then.
- You should finish this in 3 days.

-Color palette file – Colors.txt
-API documentation - Websocket.txt
-Static icon assets – (search icon & sort icon)

### Thanks for your time!


### note:
-the websocket is disconnected and I have no right of vpn, so I use the mock data to complete the coding task, and some ui interaction is not clear, I just write the empty function and complete the project throught my thinking!
